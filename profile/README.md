## What is Choosy for Mac?

Choosy is a powerful browser selection tool designed for macOS users who work with multiple web browsers. It allows you to control which browser opens links based on customizable rules, context, or manual selection. Whether you use Safari for personal browsing, Chrome for work, and Firefox for development, Choosy ensures the right link opens in the right window every time.

The application integrates deeply with macOS, supporting all popular browsers and providing seamless interaction with email clients, messaging apps, and other software. You can set rules based on the source app, URL patterns, or time of day. Choosy also offers a handy menu bar icon for quick manual selection when needed.

With support for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, Choosy runs efficiently on macOS Ventura, Sonoma, and earlier versions. Its lightweight design and background operation ensure it doesn’t slow down your system. Whether you're a developer, designer, or everyday user, Choosy brings order to your browsing experience.
